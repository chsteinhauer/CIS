# Cohclear implant simulation

SMC7 semester project.

## Group Contract


## Problem definition draft

How can we simulate the audiotory perception for cochlear implant (CI) users, to help normal-hearing (NH) people to experience the audiotory perception of CI users in real-time.

## Timeline

| Date        | Activity    | Notes       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 21/09/2022  | Supervisor meeting & group meeting | First meeting with supervisor, introductions and more research suggestions were given. We agreed to initially meet once a week, every wednesday at 9:15 in the group room. Afterwards we setup a group contract, overleaf document with the SMC paper template and a GitHub repository. |
| 26/09/2022   | Group meeting        | First we discussed the articles we read before the meeting, we attempted to go through terms we did not understand, and discussed the basic functionality of the cochlear in the inner ear. </b> Thereafter we discussed the focus of our topic, and agreed upon attempting to go in the direction of implementing the current simulation (SPIRAL) in real-time. In this we had the framework JUCE in mind. </b> Furthermore, we discussed what variables could be relevant to take into consideration in the simpulation, and what shuld be configuratble. Razvan comes to the rescue here on wednesday! |
| 28/09/2022   | Supervisor meeting        | To be continued... |
